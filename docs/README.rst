EMAS app
========

We introduced the following new content types:

Service
- a purchasable service
- can be credit or subscription based
- a credit based service allows a user access to a specific service for a set amount of times. The question-and-answer service is a credit based service.
- a subscription based service allows a users access for a set period. It has an expiry date. After this date the user no longer has access to the service. The intelligent practice service is a subscription based service.

Product
- a purchasable product

MemberService
- this represents a service (or product) that a member has purchased.
- it is associated with one and only one available service or product.
- used to determine access to products and services

Order
- represents a collection of products and/ or services that a user has ordered
- used to create invoice and notification emails as well as settlement requests to Virtual Card Services
- when an order is marked as 'payed' the relevant MemberServices are automatically created

OrderItem
- a unique product or service a user has ordered

These types of objects are contained in the following special folders:
orders
- Order (which in turn contains OrderItems)

memberservices
- MemberService

products_and_services
- Product

How it all works
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Products and services are created in the special 'Products and Services' folder.

A user indicates which of these products and services he wants to purchase.

The system creates orderitems for each of the indicated products and services.

These are kept inside a new order that is created inside the 'Orders' folder.

Emails are sent to the info account and the user to inform them of the order.

If the user chooses to settle online, the order details are sent to VCS.

VCS in turn prompts the user for the relevant credit card details.

The transaction is settled by VCS and control is returned to EMAS.

If the transaction was successful the relevant MemberServices are created in
the 'Member Services' folder.

If the transaction is declined, the user is informed and nothing more happens.

The user might choose to settle via EFT. In this case the admin is responsible
for checking the proof-of-payment, finding the relevant order and transitioning
this order to 'payed' via the Plone user interface. This will cause the creation
of the relevant MemberServices.

The system determines access to services and products by looking at the subject
and grade of the page the user is requesting. This information is used to find
all the user's memberservices for the given page. Credit and subscription
services are treating differently. For credit based services the system allows
access if the user has credits for the service. Access to subscription based
services is controlled by the expiry date. Thus if the system can find a
memberservice for the given subject:grade combination with an expiry date in the
future it will give the user access to the associated service.
