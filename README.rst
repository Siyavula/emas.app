How it all works
----------------

Products and services are created in the special 'Products and Services' folder.

A user indicates which of these products and services he wants to purchase.

The system creates an order with orderitems for each of the selected
products and services inside the top level "Orders" folder.

Emails are sent to both the info account and the user to inform them of
the order.

If the user chooses to settle online, the order details are sent to VCS.

VCS in turn prompts the user for the relevant credit card details.

The transaction is settled by VCS and control is returned to EMAS.

If the transaction was successful the relevant MemberServices are created in
the 'Member Services' folder.

If the transaction is declined, the user is informed and nothing more happens.

The user might choose to settle via EFT. In this case the admin is responsible
for verifying that payment was made by the user and proof of payment submitted.
An admin user can then search for the order in the "Orders" folder and
transition the order to "paid" via the Plone user interface. 

The system determines access to services and products by looking at the subject
and grade of the page the user is requesting. This information is used to find
all the user's memberservices for the given page. Credit and subscription
services are treated differently. For credit based services the system allows
access if the user has credits for the service. Access to subscription based
services is controlled by the expiry date. If the system can find a
memberservice for the given subject-grade combination with an expiry
date in the future it will give the user access to the associated
service.

Example
-------

John registers as a user on everythingmaths.co.za. He purchases access
to the intelligent practice service for a month and he also purchases 20
credits for the Questions-and-Answers service. He pays by credit card
via the VCS system. After successful completion of the transaction he
browses to:
grade-10/01-algebraic-expressions/01-algebraic-expressions-01.cnxmlplus
The system computes that this is a request for a maths grade 10 page. It
uses this information to check if John has any memberservices for maths
grade 10. Upon finding 2 services, QA and Intelligent Practice, it
displays the links in the premium services area.
